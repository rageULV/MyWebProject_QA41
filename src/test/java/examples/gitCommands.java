    // git checkout -b mybranch             - chenging to brench (mybrench)

    // git add .                            - add/replaces the changes you did in the code to the git
    // git commit -m "my commit MyBranch"   - commits the add command

    // git checkout main
    // git merge mybranch                   - merges the branch you are right now with other you want
    //                                      in this example I did merge main with mybranch to transfer from mybranch
    //                                      all I wrote to main
    //
    // ALT+0                                - opens window with changes. if you have conflicts while merge,
    //                                      - there will be "option" resolve there you can commit yours or theirs. (ass I understand no one doing it)
    //                                      - !!!!!!!!!!!!!!and there will be one more this MERGE(blue button)!!!!!!!!!!!!
    //                                      - if you press it will open windows with explain where is conflict
    //                                      - in that windows you have options like: '>>' meaning accept (code from somewhere that conflict with you)
    //                                      - and there will be                       'x' meaning keep your code.

    //                                      - after solving the conflicts, will pop up "Save and finish" and then you can press apply button
    // if you have done with conflicts
    // you can try commit again should work.

    // git init                              - telling that we are goin work with git and creating folder"invisible"
    //                                        !and then you need to!
